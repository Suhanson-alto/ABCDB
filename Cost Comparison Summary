Cost Comparison Summary (as of 2024‚Äì2025 estimates)
Feature	Azure Blob Storage (Cold Tier)	Azure Cosmos DB (Cold Container)
Storage Cost	~$0.01/GB/month	~$0.25/GB/month
Minimum Throughput	No RU/s charge	Min 400 RU/s = ~$24/month/container
Access Cost	Yes (per read/write)	Included in RU/s
Latency	Slower (seconds)	Fast (ms-level)
Query Capabilities	None (unless indexed via AI Search or Data Lake)	Full Cosmos DB query support
Best For	Archival, audit logs, backup	OLTP-style queries on cold data

üß† Example: 100 GB of Rarely Accessed Data
Metric	Blob Cold Tier	Cosmos DB Cold Container
Storage Cost	~$1/month	~$25/month
Access Cost	Extra (e.g., $0.01 per 10,000 reads)	Included in RU/s
Minimum RU/s	0	400 RU/s minimum ($24/month)
Total Monthly Cost	~$1‚Äì2	~$25+

If your app rarely reads cold data, Blob Storage is 10x‚Äì25x cheaper.

‚úÖ When to Use Each
Use Azure Blob Cold Tier if:
You rarely need to access old records (e.g., once a year or only for audits).

You're okay with higher latency and batch access.

You don‚Äôt need rich query support (use Azure AI Search if needed).

Use Azure Cosmos DB Cold Container if:
You still need queryable or low-latency access to old data.

You need to filter, sort, or search old data frequently.

You're okay with paying for minimum 400 RU/s (or autoscale floor).

üîÑ Hybrid Pattern (Best of Both)
Many companies use this tiered approach:

Store records <3 months in Cosmos DB (hot).

Store 3‚Äì12 months in Cosmos DB cold container (if still queried).

Store >1 year in Blob Cold or Archive tier (cheapest long-term storage).

This gives:

üî• Fast access to recent data.

‚ùÑÔ∏è Cost-optimized access to aging data.

üì¶ Super-cheap archive storage for compliance.

‚úÖ Final Verdict
Need	Recommendation
Cost savings	Blob Cold Tier wins (cheaper by far)
Query support	Cosmos DB wins
OLTP + AI workflows	Cosmos DB with indexing
Archive + compliance	Blob Cold/Archive Tier
