Failure scenarios, operational risks, and recovery strategies in production. We’ll take the “Cosmos DB + Blob Storage (with pointers)” and other likely solutions as cases. 


Latency or Failures on Old Data Retrieval
 

Problem:

Blob Storage suffers intermittent downtime, long access latency, or high load (e.g., due to traffic spike on old records).
Records restored from archive tier (e.g., Azure Blob Archive) have multi-hour latency.
Mitigation Tactics
CDN or Caching Layer: For frequently requested old records, cache on first load (e.g., using Azure Cache for Redis).
Throttling/Graceful Degradation: Return informative status ("record is being retrieved, will be available in X seconds/minutes"); queue repeat requests with back-off.
Geo-Redundant Storage: Use GRS or RA-GRS for high-availability.
Prewarm Hotset: Monitor and pre-stage records that are trending up in access frequency.

Recovery
Automatically retry reads from another region/bucket if possible.
For non-critical records, respond with a “please try again later” message and alert operations to actual outage.
 

3. Scaling, Throughput, and Cost Surprises
 

Problem
Migration jobs overwhelm Cosmos DB or Blob Storage throughput limits (RUs, IOPS).
"Cold" record reads spike due to unexpected business/customer behavior (e.g., audits).
Mitigation Tactics
Backoff & Throttle Migration Jobs: Schedule migrations during low-traffic hours and rate-limit requests per partition.
Monitor Cosmos DB RU Consumption: Setup alerts for sustained high RU usage to adjust partitioning or throughput.
Blob Storage Access Tiers: Use access policies to control egress costs.

Recovery
Temporarily increase provisioned throughput on Cosmos or Blob to match load.
Turn on detailed logging to analyze real-time usage patterns and optimize accordingly.
 

5. Operational Complexity and Silent Failures
 

Problem
Monitoring gaps, silent function failures, or misconfigured triggers lead to unarchived data, missing records, or unhandled errors (e.g., failed migrations quietly skip records).
Dev/test vs. prod drift: scripts work in one, break in another.

Mitigation Tactics
Robust Logging & Alerting: Centralized logs (App Insights, Azure Monitor) with error-level alerting on function failures and migration successes/failures.
Idempotent Operations: Migration can be retried safely without duplicating or corrupting data.
Daily Dashboard/Report: Visual report of active vs. cold records, success/failure counts, and data integrity “health” score.
Recovery
Quickly rerun or roll back batch migrations as needed.
Design system to tolerate “double-run” of migration batches for safety.
 

6. Unexpected Data Growth or Schema Changes
 
Problem
Billing record schema evolves; old migration processes do not adapt, breaking future reads or archives.
Mitigation Tactics
Schema Versioning: Each record includes a schema version. Migration can transform/normalize data on read for old versions.
Backward-Compatible Migrations: Always test old data against new code.
Recovery
Write migration/repair scripts to backfill or transform existing blobs to new schema on demand.
 

7. Regulatory and Retention Gaps
 

Problem
Deletion policies (e.g., GDPR “right to be forgotten”) fail to remove all traces from both Cosmos DB and Blob Storage.
Mitigation Tactics
Use a single authoritative source for records and regular, automated deletion of both active and archived copies.
Document and test the “delete journey” for every record.
Recovery
Manual review and delete of missed records upon detection.
 

High-Level Checklist for Production Health
 

 Automated Migration Scripts: Safe, idempotent, logged, retry-capable.
 Health Dashboards: Surface migration/statistics/alerts.
 Failover Plans: For both Cosmos DB and Blob Storage—ideally geo-redundant, with tested read/write failover.
 Runbooks for Outage Scenarios: Quick-response guides for ops.
 Penetration and Consistency Testing: Periodic, both automated and human-involved.
 Incident Response Plan: Documented, with clear escalation paths.
 

Summary Table - "What Can Break?"
 

Failure Mode	Detection	Mitigation	Recovery
Pointer/Data Mismatch	Daily health scan, logging	Atomic/audited migration, pointer check	Retry, audit, fix batch
Latency/Timeouts	User complaints, latency metrics	Caching, prefetch, region failover	Transparent retry
Out-of-Control Costs	Cost dashboards, alerts	Scheduled migration, throttling	Scale-down, rollback
Unauthorized Access	Access logs, pen tests	Key rotation, granular policies	Revoke, audit leak
Silent Failures	Error logs, missing data alerts	Alert-on-failure, canary deploys	Rerun missed batches
Schema Change Breakage	App errors, new code rollouts	Schema versioning, validation scripts	Data transformation
Deletion not Enforced	Regulatory audits, compliance scans	Systematic, joined deletes	Manual review/cleanup

### Final Recommendations			
 			
Assume partial failures: Always design the migration and access flow to tolerate one tier being temporarily unavailable.
Invest in observability: Health checks, dashboards, and alerting save you in production.
Plan for scale carefully: Especially around cost surges and read spikes for cold data.
Test failure drills: Practice simulated outages of Cosmos DB or Blob to see how your ops and engineers handle recovery.
