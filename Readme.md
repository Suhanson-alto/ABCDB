Cost Optimization Challenge: Managing Billing Records in Azure Serverless Architecture.



**Recommended Cost-Optimization Strategy
**
1. Hotâ€“Cold Data Separation
    * Hot Data: Last 3 months â†’ Stored in primary Cosmos DB container (high RUs, fast access).
    * Cold Data: Older than 3 months â†’ Moved to Azure Blob Storage (Cool tier)


**2.	Simplicity & Ease of Implementation â€“ The solution should be straightforward to deploy and maintain.**
      Cosmos DB (billing records)
      Azure Function (processes new records)
      Blob Storage (write to JSON files per month/customer)




**How You Avoid Downtime & Data Loss**
1. Set up Blob Storage for Cold Tier
Define a structure: billing-archive/year=YYYY/month=MM/customer=ID/

Enable soft-delete and lifecycle management policies (for safety)

2. Use Cosmos DB Change Feed + Azure Function
Listen for inserts/updates

If a record is older than 3 months:

Write it to blob (e.g., in JSON format)

Optionally flag the record in Cosmos DB as archived: true (initially keep it)


**Alternatives to Access Archived Data in Blob**
Hereâ€™s how you can access and query archived billing data stored in Azure Blob:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Azure Storage Explorer (GUI tool)
Download Azure Storage Explorer

Sign in to your subscription

Navigate to your Blob Container

Download or view archived JSON/CSV files

ðŸ”¹ 2. Azure Synapse + Serverless SQL Pool
You can run SQL queries directly on blobs stored in Azure using Synapse Analytics:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'https://<your-storage-account>.blob.core.windows.net/billing-archive/year=2024/month=03/customer=123/billing_2024-03.json',
    FORMAT = 'JSON'
) AS records
âœ… This gives you a queryable interface to Blob files.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Azure Function / API Gateway
Since your system already uses APIs, you can:

Implement a function like getArchivedBilling(customerId, fromDate, toDate)

Internally read blob files

Deserialize them and return results

This ensures your existing APIs stay consistent â€” even when data is in cold storage.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Use Azure Data Lake and Query with U-SQL / Data Lake Analytics
If your archived blobs are in ADLS (Data Lake Gen2), you can use tools like:

Azure Synapse

Azure Data Lake Analytics

Microsoft Fabric (formerly Power BI + Synapse)
