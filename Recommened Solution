Recommended Solution Architecture
 

Implement a TTL (Time to Live) policy in Cosmos DB (if possible) to automatically expire old docs after archival.
Create an automated workflow (ADF, Functions, Logic Apps) to:
Move records older than 3 months to Azure Blob Storage.
Delete them from Cosmos DB.
Maintain an index in Cosmos DB (or an auxiliary table) for record location.
Read Flow:
Query Cosmos DB.
If record is missing, check Blob Storage using the auxiliary index; if present, fetch and deserialize.
(Optionally, serve from cache or temporary return to Cosmos DB for accelerated secondary access.)
